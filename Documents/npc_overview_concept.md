# Overview document for all demo NPC's (v0.1)

## Purpose of this document

The main purpose is to agree on all robot NPC types, so we can prosed with individual detailed design documents. It doesn't go much into detail as this will be a job for respective design documents. This just a coarse overview.

## Robots

### Jumper

**Appeal**: Spider\
**Armor**: Weakest from all. Level 1.\
**Grouping**: Usually moves in swarms, but can also operate alone.\
**Movement**: Very fast. Can run, jump and climb.\
**Attack**: Primary attack is jump & melee attack or get close & melee attack.

### Roller

**Appeal**: Slightly inspired by animal Armadillo (the I can roll animal)\
**Armor**: Level 2-3.\
**Grouping**: Usually alone or very small groups.\
**Movement**: Middle fast. Suicide robot. It walks and runs, when seeing target grounded, changes formation and starts to roll very fast toward.\
**Attack**: Once it has rolled near enough it explodes. Will not engage if the path is not clear.

### Scout

**Appeal**: Small flying balls, drone like or with anti-gravity
**Armor**: Level 1.\
**Grouping**: Usually alone taking long distance from other scouts.\
**Movement**: Middle fast. Scouts the area. Scans it. Searching for threats.\
**Attack**: No attack. Once scout locates player it sticks to it and informs all others. Makes some disturbing sounds like an alarm.


### Soldier

**Appeal**: Inspired by humanoid
**Armor**: Level 4.\
**Grouping**: Usually in groups but also can wander alone.\
**Movement**: Middle, but faster then player. Can walk, run, jump, maybe climb as well.\
**Attack**: Can carry all kind of weapons. And switch those. Shoots at distance and does melee attack when to near. Can take cover and in general is smartest from all.
**Special notes**: I know we wanted to stay away from humanoid models. But its not just about humans. This kind of body is very effective for combat. Can hold and operate lots of guns. Can go trough doors. Duck and jump, run, take cover, etc. We can make it look less humanoid in appeal in design. Maybe more arms then 2, etc.


### Mech-like and tank

**Appeal**: Big mech-like robots and tanks.
**Armor**: Level 8.\
**Grouping**: Usually alone or small 2-3 groups.\
**Movement**: As fast as player I would say. Tank can be faster.\
**Attack**: Carries heavy weapons. Machine gun and rocket launchers, all built in. But this depends on how futuristic we design the weapons. Maybe rail guns, lasers? _TODO: figure out weapons in next version_


### Octopus boss

**Appeal**: Huge, something like [this](https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/11/auto-draft/hexapod_1.jpg)\
**Armor**: Level 20+.\
**Grouping**: Alone. Its a boss.\
**Movement**: Very slow, but its arms a bit faster.\
**Attack**: On its main body it carries weapon(s), very heavy ones, that it fires periodically. Then it attacks with his large robot arms. Etc.
